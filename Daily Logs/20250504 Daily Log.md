## üîß Technical Work Completed
- Developed and tested `linkos_desktop_setup.sh` to format the XFCE desktop with Red, Purple, and Blue Team icon layout
- Installed and configured Plank dock; resolved duplicate Brave icon issue
- Created custom `.desktop` files for Red, Purple, and Blue Team tools and ensured correct folder paths

- Identified where XFCE stores desktop icon positions (`icons.screen0.rc`) for inclusion in ISO via `/etc/skel`
- Confirmed correct Plank autostart setup and launcher population (Brave, Terminal, Obsidian pending)
- Executed GitHub commit for all current Obsidian changes using standard commit flow

## üè† Personal/Project-Related Tasks
- Reviewed official home inspection results for 1401 Hix St, Pulaski
- Analyzed HVAC system condition: poor performance, aged system (2006), exposed wiring, blower failure
- Documented full repair vs. replacement cost estimates
- Used ChatGPT to generate contractor-ready formats for both HVAC and full inspection repair lists
- Reflected on the power of AI to assist across technical, personal, and planning domains simultaneously

## üß≠ Mood Check
Productive, though mentally fatigued near the end. Confident that a full reset tomorrow will yield a polished result. Encouraged by ChatGPT's ability to tie together multiple threads.

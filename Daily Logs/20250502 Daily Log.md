**Tags:** #daily-log #linkos #debian #ai-assisted

## 🧠 Focus of the Day

- Resume structured learning and system configuration after life priorities
- Address remaining Brave browser issues and finalize desktop icon setup
- Begin documenting and validating installed Red/Blue/Purple Team tools
- Continue refining ISO for LinkOS and `/etc/skel` transfer structure

---

## ✅ What Was Accomplished

### 🖥️ System Configuration & Customization
- Brave browser successfully reopened (lock files cleared, no sudo needed)
- Side panels added to Brave for usability
- XFCE `.desktop` icons resized and repositioned
- Custom icons for Red/Blue/Purple teams corrected (partially — Blue and Purple still defaulted)

### 🗂️ Login Page Setup
- LightDM background image added (purple-team-icon2.png)
- User icon set to `LinksLinkFinal.png`
- Issues remain with LightDM not displaying both background and icon — ongoing investigation

### 🧪 ISO Development
- Confirmed `/etc/skel` structure reflects intended desktop layout for new users
- Began preparing LinkOS for multiple learner paths: 0, 30, 60, 90, 120, 150, and 180-day versions
- Discussed idea of future launch page with webform to recommend version

### 🛠️ Toolset Installation
- Confirmed tool alignment for:
  - **Red Team**: nmap, nikto, metasploit-framework
  - **Blue Team**: wazuh-agent, suricata, crowdsec
  - **Purple Team**: sigma, velociraptor, thehive
- All open-source and non-Kali-repo based
- Repository independence affirmed for LinkOS sustainability

## 📌 Themes & Reflections

- Catching up after home inspection was difficult but forward motion resumed
- Planning for structured learner progress paths adds clarity and future value
- Persistent LightDM issues highlight value of focused, single-issue debugging

---

## 🧭 Tomorrow Considerations

- Verify full login theming (background and user icon)
- Resolve remaining icon display inconsistencies (Blue and Purple team)
- Start tool validation with sample TryHackMe/HTB rooms
- Add onboarding folder structure for learners at different stages

**Mood Check:**  
Re-engaged. Balanced. Mission-focused.

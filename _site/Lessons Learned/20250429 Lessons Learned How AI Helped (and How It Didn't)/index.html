<h1>How AI Helped (and How It Didn't)</h1>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>Brief reflection on how AI tools (like DeepSeek, ChatGPT) became learning partners — but also where caution and human verification were critical.</p>
<hr>
<h2>How AI Helped Me</h2>
<ul>
<li>Helped brainstorm study plans</li>
<li>Organized scattered thoughts into structured outlines</li>
<li>Motivated me to keep moving forward</li>
<li>Simulated mentors/teachers when real ones weren’t available</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h2>Where AI Fell Short</h2>
<ul>
<li>Outdated hardware knowledge (example: gaming computers)</li>
<li>Predicted future trends without real-world confirmation</li>
<li>Occasionally overconfident in wrong answers</li>
<li>Required me to cross-verify important technical advice</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h2>Lessons Learned</h2>
<ul>
<li>AI is a powerful <strong>creative partner</strong>, not a <strong>truth oracle</strong>.</li>
<li>Verification, skepticism, and critical thinking are <em>still required skills</em> in the AI era.</li>
<li>Best results happen when <strong>AI + Human</strong> work together intentionally.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h2>Future Commitment</h2>
<ul>
<li>Always cross-check important information.</li>
<li>Treat AI advice as a starting point — <strong>not the final answer</strong>.</li>
<li>Document my verifications when using AI for technical or career decisions.</li>
</ul>

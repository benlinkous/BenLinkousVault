<h2>🎯 Context</h2>
<p>After a productive start to the week, life responsibilities—including preparing the house for inspection—interrupted the intended learning schedule. AI tools like ChatGPT were still used, but mainly on mobile and without completing technical follow-ups. This resulted in some gaps in progress tracking and tool installation.</p>

<h2>🧠 What I Learned</h2>
<h3>1. Disruption is Part of the Journey</h3>
<ul>
<li>Transitioning into a new life rhythm means learning how to navigate unexpected disruptions.</li>
<li>Even when momentum is lost, <strong>documenting what happened</strong> helps reduce guilt and restore clarity.</li>
</ul>
<h3>2. Mobile AI Use ≠ Deep Work</h3>
<ul>
<li>ChatGPT on a phone is useful for planning, ideation, and brainstorming.</li>
<li>It is <strong>not a substitute</strong> for focused implementation or configuration work (e.g., Brave fixes, XFCE updates).</li>
</ul>
<h3>3. Physical Life and Digital Projects Are Intertwined</h3>
<ul>
<li>Home inspections, RV planning, and water logistics aren’t separate from learning—they’re <strong>logistics challenges</strong> that reflect systems thinking and adaptability.</li>
<li>These events can serve as real-world learning prompts if captured properly.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h2>📌 Adjustment Going Forward</h2>
<ul>
<li>Accept that not every day will allow for progress, but every day can still be documented.</li>
<li>When “off-track,” resume with <strong>priority catch-up</strong>: uncompleted tasks, tool installs, updates to LinkOS.</li>
<li>Use <strong>Daily Logs</strong> and <strong>Lessons Learned</strong> to reset mentally and structurally.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h2>📝 Next Actions</h2>
<ul>
<li>Finalize Brave setup and team icons on Debian</li>
<li>Install core tools for Red, Blue, and Purple Team categories</li>
<li>Validate <code>/etc/skel</code> persistence for LinkOS ISO preparation</li>
<li>Resume Obsidian journaling with daily structure</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Key Reflection:</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>The rhythm of learning isn’t broken by real life—it evolves with it.</em></p>

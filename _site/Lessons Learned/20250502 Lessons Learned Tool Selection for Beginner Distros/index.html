<h1>20250502 Lessons Learned Tool Selection for Beginner Distros</h1>
<h2>🎯 Purpose</h2>
<p>To reflect on the selection of tools for a beginner-friendly security-focused Linux distribution (LinkOS), aligned with both project-based learning and free educational platforms like TryHackMe and Hack The Box.</p>
<hr>
<h2>🔍 Lesson Summary</h2>
<p>Although tools like <code>nmap</code>, <code>nikto</code>, <code>metasploit-framework</code>, <code>wazuh</code>, <code>suricata</code>, <code>crowdsec</code>, <code>velociraptor</code>, <code>sigma</code>, and <code>thehive</code> were proposed, <strong>they have not yet been installed</strong>. This gap is an important moment for learning:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Good planning is not execution — and effective documentation means identifying what's <em>next</em>, not just what was <em>intended</em>.</p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<h2>📌 Takeaways</h2>
<ul>
<li>✅ Tool selection is aligned with CompTIA objectives (Network+, Security+, CySA+, Pentest+)</li>
<li>✅ Red/Blue/Purple team categories are meaningful and support learning pathways</li>
<li>❌ Installation not yet complete</li>
<li>❌ Testing and verification of portability, stability, and user experience remains</li>
</ul>

<h2>🔧 Needed Actions</h2>
<ul>
<li>[ ] Install tools using Debian-compatible sources (no Kali repos)</li>
<li>[ ] Test each for stability in a minimal distro context</li>
<li>[ ] Document default paths and launch commands</li>
<li>[ ] Create <code>.desktop</code> launchers for each tool</li>
<li>[ ] Align tool usage with THM/HTB rooms and CompTIA exam topics</li>
</ul>

<h2>💡 Closing Thought</h2>
<p>Selecting tools is an act of <em>curriculum design</em>. What you include — and what you intentionally leave out — defines the learner’s experience. The install and test process will finalize what LinkOS truly <em>teaches</em>.</p>

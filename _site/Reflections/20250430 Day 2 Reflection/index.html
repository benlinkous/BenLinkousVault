<p>AI Assisted</p>
<h3>ðŸ§  <strong>Reflections from Day 2</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p>AI helped me stay organized and offered suggestions when I was too tired to think.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I made it back into my Debian system. Thatâ€™s huge.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I didnâ€™t do much else that day â€” but this task took enough effort to count for several hours of learning.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I need to improve how I <em>track what I actually do</em> during these moments so I can capture the growth later.</p>
</li>
</ul>

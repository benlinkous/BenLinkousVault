<h1>üîÑ Reset Post | Catching Up &amp; Realigning (2025-05-04)</h1>
<h2>‚è≥ The Last Few Days</h2>
<p>After a productive Tuesday last week (especially while traveling by train), I had great momentum in both system customization and documentation. However, life quickly demanded attention elsewhere. From prepping the house for an inspection to exploring off-grid living at RV parks, the days that followed were full of necessary non-digital progress but scattered in terms of IT learning focus.</p>
<h3>What Went Well:</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Brave Browser</strong> was successfully installed and configured, including recovery from a launch issue.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>ChatGPT remained in use</strong> throughout the week, mostly via mobile. This allowed for ongoing reflection, planning, and solution development even while away from the desktop.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Life planning progress</strong>: Explored realistic housing transitions, water independence, and new career pathways (e.g., Home Inspector).</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>What Slipped:</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Obsidian vault entries were not maintained daily.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Tasks such as refining desktop icons, setting XFCE layout, and ISO prep were planned but not executed.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Project milestones, like aligning tools with CompTIA certs and THM/HTB rooms, were started but not finalized in vault entries or markdown.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>‚úä Recommitment Plan</h2>
<p>Today, I hit reset.<br>
This post marks a return to <strong>disciplined documentation</strong>, <strong>incremental ISO development</strong>, and <strong>refined alignment of tools-to-learning-outcomes</strong>.</p>
<p>I acknowledge the breaks in rhythm, but I also embrace that this is a <strong>life-integrated learning journey</strong>, not a rigid sprint. I‚Äôve gained knowledge through real-world action, and now it‚Äôs time to anchor that growth.</p>
<h3>Immediate Priorities</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Finalize missing documentation logs (May 1‚Äì4)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Push Day 3‚Äì5 Obsidian entries to GitHub</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Resume ISO testing with <code>/etc/skel</code> and login visuals</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Revisit tool installs and ensure alignment to:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Free TryHackMe/HackTheBox rooms</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>CompTIA objectives (ITF+ through Security+)</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Guiding Principle</h3>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Discipline is not rigidity. It is the commitment to return.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Let this be the post that transitions the past few days from &quot;scattered&quot; to &quot;processed.&quot; The learning continues. The mission is still clear.</p>
<p>Next up: Finalize the May 1‚Äì4 daily logs and push them to the vault.</p>

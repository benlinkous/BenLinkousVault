<ul>
<li>Prioritized home life: final prep for inspection.</li>
<li>Site visits to RV parks for potential relocation.</li>
<li>Mobile-based AI research on:
<ul>
<li>Water solutions for RV life with seasonal water shut-off.</li>
<li>Feasibility of home inspection careers in Virginia.</li>
<li>Off-grid water storage and purification (Berkey, rainwater collection, dual-purpose trailers).</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

<h2>✅ What Was Accomplished</h2>
<h3>🏠 House and Transition Tasks</h3>
<ul>
<li>Completed full house cleanup and readiness for scheduled inspection.</li>
<li>Reviewed and confirmed identified repair/fix list items.</li>
</ul>
<h3>🚐 RV and Relocation Scouting</h3>
<ul>
<li>Visited multiple RV park locations:
<ul>
<li>Explored tiny house setups.</li>
<li>Viewed both fixed RVs and empty plots.</li>
<li>Noted water availability cutoffs after Nov 1st.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>📱 AI-Assisted Mobile Research</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Water logistics for off-grid/seasonal RV use:</p>
<ul>
<li>Explored 1,000-gallon tank insulation, transfer logistics.</li>
<li>Defined use case for 250-gallon transport tank on enclosed trailer.</li>
<li>Mapped Berkey water filtration integration and potential automation.</li>
<li>Evaluated rainwater catchment viability for supplemental water use.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Career Exploration: Home Inspection</p>
<ul>
<li>Researched Virginia DPOR licensing process.</li>
<li>Outlined fixed/variable costs, certification routes, and demand.</li>
<li>Assessed husband-wife team potential and income projections.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

<h2>📌 Reflections</h2>
<ul>
<li>While no system development was done today, it was a highly productive <strong>transition support day</strong>.</li>
<li>AI proved useful even on the phone — helping validate decisions, brainstorm future income paths, and reinforce the value of multi-disciplinary problem-solving.</li>
<li>Projects like LinkOS will benefit from stability in home setup and lifestyle decisions.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h2>🧭 Tomorrow Considerations</h2>
<ul>
<li>Finalize and install LinkOS tools (Red, Blue, Purple Team apps).</li>
<li>Resume Obsidian and GitHub backlog.</li>
<li>Begin outlining sample onboarding content for LinkOS project learners.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<p><strong>Mood Check:</strong><br>
Focused on real-world progress. Ready to return to system work.</p>

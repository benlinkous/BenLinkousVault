<h2>🔁 Reflection</h2>
<p>The week has been a study in how quickly structure can dissolve when life steps in. The day began with chores and obligations — but still ended in productivity. The LinkOS vision remains on track. It just needs deliberate re-entry, and that starts now.</p>
<hr>
<p><strong>Mood Check:</strong><br>
Determined. Behind but grounded. Grateful for second chances.</p>

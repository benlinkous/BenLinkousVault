<h1>Stream of Consciousness</h1>

<p>Here we go—it's been quite an eventful week.</p>
<p>I returned back on Tuesday of last week from the office, where I rode the train in. I had quite a few great (well, great to me) ideas that I wanted to follow through with, but woke up on Wednesday to find my computer didn't load. I had done an update, and for some reason, the Kali repository caused issues with my login. My Debian system didn’t load, and I spent the day trying to figure out GRUB and XFCE versus GNOME. In the end, I understand it pretty well.</p>
<p>It caused me to be curious about setting up my own ISO, so I did what I always do—ask AI. It turns out that a Debian-based system is not terribly hard to make my own and distribute as an ISO, just like Kali, Parrot, Ubuntu, etc. I did have this naive thought that maybe a person could start with bare-bones Debian and add tools to make it a complete attack box like Kali or Parrot. Like I said, that’s naive. The repos that are updated regularly take significant upkeep to ensure the ethical hacker is provided the right tools.</p>
<p>For my ISO, I will concentrate on education. What I’ve found in Kali and Parrot is that I am overwhelmed with the tools and don’t end up using any of them. I wonder if there’s anyone else like this.</p>
<p>I want to provide just a few basic tools in the Red Team, Blue Team, and Purple Team categories to explore using vulnerable labs or capture-the-flag-type websites (TryHackMe, HackTheBox) in the free category, and explore the vast &quot;Cyber&quot; learning space. I also believe that building a portfolio that can be seen by potential employers is the way to break into &quot;Cyber.&quot;</p>
<p>So there we are. An ISO is launched and will be released soon. I know you’re excited.</p>
<p>I was curious about backups, so AI taught me how to use Obsidian to document my journey. I have several categories. ChatGPT helps me with my <strong>Lessons Learned</strong>, <strong>Closeouts</strong>, and <strong>Daily Logs</strong>, but I want my <strong>Diary</strong> and <strong>Reflection</strong> to be just my voice—with grammar and formatting help.</p>
<p>I also learned through AI to use a GitHub account to back up my Obsidian vault. I now can use the command line to commit the vault to GitHub. I have <strong>BenLinkousVault</strong>, which is private for now (maybe I’ll make it public for full transparency?), and the <strong>LinkOS</strong> vault (for my OS), which is public. AI helped me produce some of the required documents. I guess it would make sense to link them here—hope ChatGPT can help.</p>
<p>Should I name ChatGPT? Maybe later.</p>
<p>So Thursday of last week, I went down a rabbit hole of images. <strong>Link Tribe</strong> became <strong>Link’s Nexus</strong> because of possible cultural offense tied to the &quot;Tribe&quot; reference and imagery. I'm still not happy with the name. I want something to describe a group committed to each other with bonds like chain links—invested in each other’s success. Maybe I’ll figure out a name.</p>
<p>This morning, it was <strong>Link’Squad</strong>—but the .com name costs 8 grand. The .org is available. I may just get it. I’ll probably wake up tomorrow and not be happy with that name either, though.</p>
<p>I do have a desire to build about 10 websites that log my many curiosities. Sometimes it’s aggravating not to just settle on small, achievable goals. Instead, my mind races to the many things I want to do, and I get caught in a web. Then I’m overloaded and unproductive—so I take a nap.</p>
<p>I love naps. I can sleep through almost anything. I once went to sleep on a .50 cal range.</p>
<p>Speaking of sleep, I am having more dreams. Last night, I dreamed about being in a combat zone and couldn’t find my pistol. My crew and I were not properly outfitted, and we were waiting to leave. A new company came in and made fun of us for being unfit and ill-prepared for combat. I don’t know why I still care about military stuff in my dreams. I haven’t been in combat for 20 years. I haven’t had a job in the military that was war-fighting for fifteen—and it's mainly been admin.</p>
<p>I have no idea why it matters. All I know is that this transition into retirement has been, without a doubt, the most difficult time in my life. I am anxious and worry about the future. I am not sure how to help myself or my family.</p>
<p>I don’t care about officiating sports anymore—or sports in general. I just don’t care. News and social media, too. It just doesn’t matter like it did. It all seems fake, and why should I get wrapped up in sports or politics when the participants could care less? I deleted Facebook from my phone a couple weeks ago. It also seems fake—people only telling you what they would like for you to believe.</p>
<p>In any case, at least I have my wife and close family. I want to make a huge impact in the remaining years of my life. I am leaving the military largely unfulfilled. I made a difference in a handful of people after 31 years. It wasn’t a waste—it provided us compensation and many opportunities—but in hindsight, I don’t believe I “mattered” as much as some of my evaluations led me to believe I did 10 years ago.</p>
<p>I want to make a difference now—to my family, in my community, to fellow vets in similar struggles. I just want to serve and matter. I’m not sure how that will look. The tech stuff is fun. For now, that’s where I want to focus.</p>
<p>Maybe I’ll even get a job soon. It’s too early to nap—maybe I’ll try to design a website or apply to some jobs.</p>

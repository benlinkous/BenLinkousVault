<h1>Where I Was Three Months Ago â€“ The Real Start</h1>
<p><strong>Date:</strong> 2025-04-29</p>
<p>So here we are. I am on a train heading in to work on the first day after my Skillbridge ended. Skillbridge is an opportunity for some in the military to intern with a company prior to military transition with the hope of landing a job.  There are other opportunities as well. I happened to use AllegiantVets which allows you to use Coursera to get credentials. I like Coursera but feel like true learning comes from projects.  AllegiantVets is awesome. They allow you to learn but also facilitate your transition with a strong emphasis on getting Va disbility taken care of.  More on that later.</p>
<p>I learned a lot about IT through AllegiantVets and Skillbridge. The only weekly requirement was to attend a meeting on Tuesday where we told &quot;Wins of the Week&quot; and then had breakout rooms for presenters that generally spoke about training opportunities, investment opportunities, VA loan utilization,  and entrepreneurial opportunities.  Rarely was there a company that would be willing to give you a shot at joining their company.  There are placement companies like 7 Eagle Group that will try to get an internship in a company and be paid a sponsorship fee if you are hired. Not terrible right?  The company gets &quot;free&quot; labor, the service member gets an opportunity to gain experience and if it's a good fit then the service member is given a job.  When this occurs, companies like 7 Eagle Group get paid.  I find the only missing piece is gaining experience prior to the &quot;internship&quot; so the likelihood of attaining permanent job placement is higher. But I digress, let's not get into that quite yet.</p>
<p>AllegiantVets also has an empowerment week. It is helpful and is like the Tuesday meeting for a week. Lots of presentations, lots of LinkedIn and Resume improvement courses, many opportunities for investment, training, entrepreneurship but very few hire-ready companies willing to give you a shot.  That's fair. I don't want anything for free. I want to earn it-but... I feel like 31 years of military experience should count for something and I did not receive much interest at all except for 7 Eagle Group that was willing to bring me on unpaid except for a percentage of the sponsorship fee if the service member chooses to join the company.</p>
<p>I guess it would be important to briefly mention my career at this point.  I was lucky to be in the Army as a mechanic then medic then nurse then Drill Sergeant then Career Counselor. I got significantly more out of the military than I sacrificed. It provided me and my family many opportunities I would not have otherwise had. That said, I am done (for now) with the structure and limitations that the military requires to be effective. The last 15 years or so was in the Career Counselor role. I have done war-fighting stuff in the last 20 years-it really feels like two different careers.  I love helping others find their way both in the military and after.  I hope I can find something like that now-but, again, recruiters are not blowing up my LinkedIn looking for me to join them.</p>
<h2>Life Context</h2>
<ul>
<li>Selling a house, family pet loss, mental health struggles.</li>
</ul>
<p>I have long been advised to keep up with my medical records to get a decent VA Disability check in the end.  I always wanted to push hard to be physically fit like everyone else. It was a point of personal pride to be &quot;old&quot; and outperform the young folks.  So, I didn't go to medical often. I didn't start taking daily medicine until September of last year (and antidepressant but we will get to that).  I went to the Doctor in September due to a bit of memory loss. I also went for documenting a few of my ailments (ankles that I have twisted, feet that have not cared for, shoulders that don't always work right, and mental health). Full disclosure-my treatment initially was to try to show that after 31 years I was not the person that just one week prior to entry into the military graduated from high school.  60 pounds and many injuries later, here I was and I felt that service-connected disabilities was pretty certain.</p>
<p>Ok let's revisit this later. Suffice it to say, the stress of transition, selling a house, Duke my dog dying contributed to my mental health decline.  That struggle continues but the military transition train keeps rolling just like this Amtrak that is going from Roanoke to Alexandria and 20 kids as giddy as my 16-year old Anna just boarded and are distracting me.</p>
<h2>Curiosities and Interests Sparked</h2>
<ul>
<li>Learning cloud computing (AWS, GCP, Azure)</li>
<li>Using AI (DeepSeek, ChatGPT) as learning partners</li>
</ul>
<p>I will talk about this later.  Suffice it to say AI is the perfect learning partner because of having to verify everything.  Project learning worked best for me.  Let's pause that for now.</p>

### ðŸ§  **Reflections from Day 2**

- AI helped me stay organized and offered suggestions when I was too tired to think.
    
- I made it back into my Debian system. Thatâ€™s huge.
    
- I didnâ€™t do much else that day â€” but this task took enough effort to count for several hours of learning.
    
- I need to improve how I _track what I actually do_ during these moments so I can capture the growth later.

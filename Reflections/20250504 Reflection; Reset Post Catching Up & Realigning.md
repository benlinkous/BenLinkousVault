# 🔄 Reset Post | Catching Up & Realigning (2025-05-04)

## ⏳ The Last Few Days

After a productive Tuesday last week (especially while traveling by train), I had great momentum in both system customization and documentation. However, life quickly demanded attention elsewhere. From prepping the house for an inspection to exploring off-grid living at RV parks, the days that followed were full of necessary non-digital progress but scattered in terms of IT learning focus.

### What Went Well:

- **Brave Browser** was successfully installed and configured, including recovery from a launch issue.
    
- **ChatGPT remained in use** throughout the week, mostly via mobile. This allowed for ongoing reflection, planning, and solution development even while away from the desktop.
    
- **Life planning progress**: Explored realistic housing transitions, water independence, and new career pathways (e.g., Home Inspector).
    

### What Slipped:

- Obsidian vault entries were not maintained daily.
    
- Tasks such as refining desktop icons, setting XFCE layout, and ISO prep were planned but not executed.
    
- Project milestones, like aligning tools with CompTIA certs and THM/HTB rooms, were started but not finalized in vault entries or markdown.
    

## ✊ Recommitment Plan

Today, I hit reset.  
This post marks a return to **disciplined documentation**, **incremental ISO development**, and **refined alignment of tools-to-learning-outcomes**.

I acknowledge the breaks in rhythm, but I also embrace that this is a **life-integrated learning journey**, not a rigid sprint. I’ve gained knowledge through real-world action, and now it’s time to anchor that growth.

### Immediate Priorities

-  Finalize missing documentation logs (May 1–4)
    
-  Push Day 3–5 Obsidian entries to GitHub
    
-  Resume ISO testing with `/etc/skel` and login visuals
    
-  Revisit tool installs and ensure alignment to:
    
    - Free TryHackMe/HackTheBox rooms
        
    - CompTIA objectives (ITF+ through Security+)
        

### Guiding Principle

> _Discipline is not rigidity. It is the commitment to return._

Let this be the post that transitions the past few days from "scattered" to "processed." The learning continues. The mission is still clear.

Next up: Finalize the May 1–4 daily logs and push them to the vault.

- Learned chroot-based recovery in a practical scenario
    
- Saw the consequences of uncontrolled repository mixing
    
- Gained confidence in identifying and resolving graphical environment failures

## 📝 Reflection

The day didn’t feel “productive” in a traditional sense — but it absolutely was.  
Recovering from system collapse **without reinstalling** showed how far my skills (and patience) have come.  
AI helped shape the process, but the hard work was mine. This wasn’t just a win — it was a **foundation**.

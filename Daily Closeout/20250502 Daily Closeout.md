# 20250502 Daily Closeout – Design Deepens, Tools Begin

## ✅ Summary of Today’s Progress

Today reflected a continued transition from recovery to refinement in the LinkOS project. Major focus areas included:

- Finalized naming transition from “Link’s Link” to **Link’s Nexus** as the overarching brand.
- Clarified structural hierarchy:
  - **LinkOS** = Debian-based distro for IT learning
  - **Link’s Nexus** = umbrella brand for projects and themes
  - Red/Blue/Purple Team icons preserved
- Identified persistent desktop icon formatting issues and began aligning `/etc/skel` for ISO inheritance.
- Worked toward setting up login screen visuals and Brave browser environment defaults.

---

## 🧩 Tasks Advanced or Completed

- Resolved naming schema and brand documentation
- Cleaned XFCE desktop of default icons (Trash, File System, Home)
- Confirmed Brave browser opens without errors
- Positioned three desktop icons for team tools (pending final formatting)
- Verified LightDM greeter loads (but splash background/icon still pending)
- Started tracking legacy issues with hostnames, LightDM, and XFCE defaults

---

## 🧠 Reflections & Insights

- Seeing the OS begin to look like *my own* gave energy back.
- Customization is more tedious than expected — XFCE quirks require persistence.
- Removing branding and cruft from other distros feels like reclaiming control.
- A clean, intentional desktop is part of the educational message of LinkOS.

## 🗓️ Tomorrow’s Priorities

- Finalize icon formatting and desktop layout
- Confirm LightDM splash background and user icon display
- Start installing and documenting the 9 core tools (Red/Blue/Purple)
- Begin draft of onboarding guide or welcome screen text

---

**Mood Check:** Focused. Determined. Still catching up, but hopeful.

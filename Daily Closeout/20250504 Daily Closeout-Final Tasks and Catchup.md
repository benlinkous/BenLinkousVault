# 20250504 Daily Closeout – Final Tasks and Catchup

## ✅ Completed Highlights
- Initiated LinkOS ISO desktop setup with script-driven XFCE and Plank configuration
- Installed and customized Plank with Brave and Terminal; identified missing launcher for Obsidian
- Created and validated `.desktop` icons for Red 🐍, Purple 🐆, and Blue 🧹 Teams with appropriate folders
- Diagnosed non-functional drag/drop behavior and corrected missing folder paths
- Discovered XFCE icon positioning is saved in `icons.screen0.rc`; confirmed `/etc/skel` is needed for ISO user defaults
- Adjusted script logic for `xfconf-query` to use `--create` for missing properties
- Verified GitHub sync of all Obsidian files and logs with correct commit workflow
- Received and reviewed official home inspection report, including HVAC analysis
- Used ChatGPT to format contractor-ready summaries and repair lists
- Integrated HVAC cost logic into lessons learned and future repair planning

## 📌 Open Tasks for Tomorrow
- Finalize `linkos_desktop_setup.sh` script with all corrections (wallpaper, icon size, layout, Plank contents)
- Add fallback checks for missing `.desktop` files (e.g., Obsidian)
- Capture icon layout file (`icons.screen0.rc`) after manual positioning
- Copy finalized layout and config to `/etc/skel` for ISO default user environment
- Continue HVAC replacement research and connect with contractors for quotes
- Prepare Markdown export of all repair estimates for personal and appraisal records

## 🔋 Energy Level
Winding down — the day was highly productive but required deep focus and multi-context switching.

## 📅 Readiness for Tomorrow
Fully reset and ready to execute. LinkOS desktop formatting is nearing completion, and inspection documentation is under control.

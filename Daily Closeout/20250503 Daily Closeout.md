# 20250503 Daily Closeout – Catching Up After Life Priorities

## 🧾 Summary of the Day
Today was a continuation of regaining momentum after several days dominated by life tasks and responsibilities. After successfully prepping the house for inspection and evaluating RV park options yesterday, Link returned to the technical workflow.

Progress was made catching up on the learning journey documentation for April 30 through May 2. Clarified the real start date of the AI learning documentation as April 29, and began structuring everything into Obsidian using `.md` files with a clean, consistent naming format.

## ✅ Key Actions Completed
- Confirmed correct format and naming for all files moving forward (no underscores, date-first)
- Finalized and documented:
  - 20250430 Daily Log
  - 20250430 Daily Closeout
  - 20250430 Lessons Learned – GRUB Recovery
  - 20250501 Daily Log
  - 20250501 Daily Closeout
  - 20250501 Lessons Learned – Linux Usability and Branding Integration
  - 20250502 Daily Log
  - 20250502 Daily Closeout
  - 20250502 Lessons Learned – Tool Installation Workflow
- Ensured `.md` files are now consistently prepared for easy Obsidian copy/paste and Vault import
- Downloaded and saved 20250503 Daily Log to local system

## 🕳️ Still Outstanding
- Red, Blue, and Purple Team tools have been selected but **not yet installed**
- Brave browser side panel customization is pending
- Obsidian vault GitHub sync still needs to be verified
- Further exploration of LinkOS test user and `/etc/skel` verification is queued

## 🧠 Reflections
- The shift to full `.md` file support and naming discipline is key to long-term maintainability
- Even partial days of work (like today) feel valuable when structure is advanced
- It’s okay to have off-days — what matters is getting back to center

## 📌 Notes for Tomorrow
- Complete tool installation for all three team categories
- Finalize Brave browser fix and appearance updates
- Push all missing `.md` logs and updates to Obsidian vault
- Evaluate whether the learning backlog from May 2 is now fully addressed

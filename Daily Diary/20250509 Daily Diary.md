# Diary Entry – Stream of Consciousness

**Date:** 2025-05-09

I am sitting on the porch at the Sheraton Vistana Resort in Orlando, awaiting a day full of magic at one of the four parks (likely Animal Kingdom). Yesterday was Magic Kingdom. I loved it—mostly (except when my granddaughter screamed at me with hate in front of the whole food court because she wanted her dad to help her, not me). She is my princess, though. She was just tired. She wants what she wants, and she usually gets it.

She did a makeup thing as Princess Belle. She was beautiful.

This has been a lot of fun. We piled up in a Jeep Wagoneer on Tuesday morning around 9 a.m. in Mooresville, NC. Usually, I have to drive, but my daughter-in-law Briana decided to take the wheel this time. I was able to just relax and ride. We arrived at the villa, and it's a nice 15-minute trip to the parks.

My daughter has cheer practice this evening and a competition tomorrow at least, at the ESPN Wide World of Sports. She’ll do great, and the season will come to an end.

On Wednesday, we went to Epcot for the hottest day since I did a pleasure tour overlooking the Euphrates for a year about 20 years ago. I was too hot to drink an afternoon coffee. I don't think that has ever happened. It was okay once we figured out where to cool off. *"The Racatoi"* (check that spelling, AI). We started with a line to see Elsa and Anna. They do a great job finding actresses that look like the cartoons. It is a bit magical to see them live.

Wednesday morning started with my grandson Caden and I going for a walk and checking things out. We came back and figured out the coffee maker. Then I took all three of the grandkids that are with me for a quick walk. Lots of lizards, a turtle, and a couple ducks—then we made it back to the villa to load up for Epcot.

Thursday morning, my other grandson Beckham helped me with breakfast (scrambled eggs, biscuits, toast). Kylie helped us crack the eggs. The eight of us shared a 40-piece of nuggets from McDonald’s on the way. We rode the boat over, and it was magical.

We had to rush to get to the castle for Kylie’s appointment, but then settled in for the 7 Dwarfs roller coaster and Space Mountain. I was able to get an afternoon coffee today. Cloudy skies for a few minutes intermittently and two passing thunderstorms made the afternoon much more pleasant.

Everybody did make fun of the way I was walking, though, because I got a little chaffed. TMI?

We watched the most amazing fireworks display and show. We were herded like cattle to get on the monorail and then to the tram to get to the car. We got back to the villa and enjoyed each other’s company.

It has been wonderful. Mattering to people matters. I love my family.

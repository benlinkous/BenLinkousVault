## 🧠 Key Lessons Learned

### 🎯 XFCE Usability and Icon Positioning

- XFCE allows manual control over desktop icons via `.desktop` files placed in `~/Desktop`.
- While icon size and appearance can be controlled via settings (`xfdesktop-settings`), exact icon **positioning on ISO** requires default layout configuration.
- Positioning can be saved in `~/.config/xfce4/desktop/icons.screen0.rc`, and replicated through `/etc/skel` for ISO persistence.

### 🎨 Login Screen Branding

- LightDM login theming is controlled via `/etc/lightdm/lightdm-gtk-greeter.conf`.
- Successfully added:
  - Background image: `purple-team-icon2.png`
  - User icon: `LinksLinkFinal.png` (in proper folder)

- Issue: Background image did not display until image permissions and paths were double-checked.

### 🛠️ Hostname Theming Caveat

- Changing hostname (e.g., from `LinkTribe` to `LinksNexus`) does **not automatically reflect** in all prompts (like `PS1`) unless `~/.bashrc` or `/etc/hostname` is fully updated and applied with `sudo hostnamectl set-hostname`.

### 🔄 Lessons on Workflow

- Icon and branding changes require persistence across boots and new users — `/etc/skel` is essential.
- Always test with a **new user** before assuming ISO changes are baked in.

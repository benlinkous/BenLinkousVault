# 20250502 Lessons Learned Tool Selection for Beginner Distros

## 🎯 Purpose

To reflect on the selection of tools for a beginner-friendly security-focused Linux distribution (LinkOS), aligned with both project-based learning and free educational platforms like TryHackMe and Hack The Box.

---

## 🔍 Lesson Summary

Although tools like `nmap`, `nikto`, `metasploit-framework`, `wazuh`, `suricata`, `crowdsec`, `velociraptor`, `sigma`, and `thehive` were proposed, **they have not yet been installed**. This gap is an important moment for learning:

> Good planning is not execution — and effective documentation means identifying what's *next*, not just what was *intended*.

---

## 📌 Takeaways

- ✅ Tool selection is aligned with CompTIA objectives (Network+, Security+, CySA+, Pentest+)
- ✅ Red/Blue/Purple team categories are meaningful and support learning pathways
- ❌ Installation not yet complete
- ❌ Testing and verification of portability, stability, and user experience remains

---

## 🔧 Needed Actions

- [ ] Install tools using Debian-compatible sources (no Kali repos)
- [ ] Test each for stability in a minimal distro context
- [ ] Document default paths and launch commands
- [ ] Create `.desktop` launchers for each tool
- [ ] Align tool usage with THM/HTB rooms and CompTIA exam topics

---

## 💡 Closing Thought

Selecting tools is an act of *curriculum design*. What you include — and what you intentionally leave out — defines the learner’s experience. The install and test process will finalize what LinkOS truly *teaches*.

# How AI Helped (and How It Didn't)

## Introduction
Brief reflection on how AI tools (like DeepSeek, ChatGPT) became learning partners — but also where caution and human verification were critical.

---

## How AI Helped Me
- Helped brainstorm study plans
- Organized scattered thoughts into structured outlines
- Motivated me to keep moving forward
- Simulated mentors/teachers when real ones weren’t available

---

## Where AI Fell Short
- Outdated hardware knowledge (example: gaming computers)
- Predicted future trends without real-world confirmation
- Occasionally overconfident in wrong answers
- Required me to cross-verify important technical advice

---

## Lessons Learned
- AI is a powerful **creative partner**, not a **truth oracle**.
- Verification, skepticism, and critical thinking are *still required skills* in the AI era.
- Best results happen when **AI + Human** work together intentionally.

---

## Future Commitment
- Always cross-check important information.
- Treat AI advice as a starting point — **not the final answer**.
- Document my verifications when using AI for technical or career decisions.

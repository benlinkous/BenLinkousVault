## üìö Integration with Training & Exams

- **Tech+ (ITF+)** introduced CLI basics, file systems, storage, permissions, and scripting.
- **A+ Core 1** added hardware validation, virtualization, networking tools, and troubleshooting methodology.
- **A+ Core 2** introduced system security, endpoint protection, operational procedures, and system repair simulation.
- **Security+** added encryption, firewall rules, vulnerability scanning (with `nmap`, `hashdeep`), and simulated incident response with log tools and `fail2ban`.

---

## üìÅ Outcome

By Day 30:
- All Day 30 tools were installed and confirmed operational.
- Custom verification scripts (`Check_LinkOS_Day_30_Tools_Corrected.sh`) were developed.
- Markdown reports were generated for audit and documentation.
- The system is now fully staged for Day 60 (CySA+, Network+, Pentest+) toolset installation and verification.

---

## üöÄ Next Steps

- Build and validate Day 60 tools with a similar verification checklist.
- Create install automation scripts grouped by training phase.
- Finalize `/etc/skel` template to auto-provision toolset on new LinkOS installations.

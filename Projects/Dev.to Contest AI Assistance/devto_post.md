## 🚀 What I Built

CyberSentinel AI is a project built by a self-taught IT learner (that’s me!) who’s exploring how artificial intelligence can help detect threats online — especially phishing, scams, and emerging cyber risks.

This project crawls public data (Reddit and other forums), uses a local AI model to summarize findings, and displays risk results in a searchable dashboard. It was built using open-source tools and pure curiosity.

## 🧠 Why I Did This

I’m not a professional developer or cybersecurity expert. I’m a beginner using AI tools to **learn in public** — and this contest was the perfect excuse to build something real while teaching myself as I go.

## 🔧 Tech Stack

- Python
- Streamlit
- FAISS (search)
- Ollama + Mistral (or any LLM)
- Reddit API (or simulated data)
- LangChain / FastAPI (optional)

## 💡 Key Features

- Real-time threat feed crawler (via API)
- LLM that classifies risk and summarizes threats
- Searchable vector database (via FAISS)
- Simple Streamlit UI

## 📚 What I Learned

- Prompt engineering for threat classification
- Crawling and transforming data
- Using LangChain and vector search (RAG)
- How to start small, stay consistent, and ship a project

## 🔗 GitHub

Coming soon...

## 🙏 Thanks

To Bright Data, Dev.to, and all the open-source creators who make it possible to build and learn like this as a beginner.

# CyberSentinel-AI Progress Log
*For Obsidian Vault â€“ May 17, 2025*

---

## ðŸ§  Project Purpose
Create a beginner-friendly AI-powered cybersecurity project for the **Bright Data Real-Time AI Agents Challenge**. The goal is not to win, but to **learn, document transparently, and submit something thoughtful** by **May 25**.

## âœ… What Was Done Today

### ðŸ”¹ 1. Project Concept and Setup
- Chose project name: **CyberSentinel-AI**
- Defined objective: Use AI to summarize cyber threat data and make it searchable
- Decided to document everything in Obsidian and GitHub

### ðŸ”¹ 2. Project Folder + GitHub Repo
- Created local project folder: `~/Documents/CyberSentinel-AI`
- Initialized Git
- Created GitHub repo and pushed initial commit
- Added a proper `.gitignore` for Python

### ðŸ”¹ 3. Downloaded and Organized:
- `README.md` (project description)
- `devto_post.md` (blog draft for Dev.to submission)

### ðŸ”¹ 4. Project Scaffold Built
Created a scaffolded Python project with the following structure:

```
CyberSentinel-AI/
â”œâ”€â”€ data/
â”œâ”€â”€ src/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ main.py          # Streamlit app placeholder
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ summarizer.py    # Placeholder summarization logic
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ search.py        # Placeholder for FAISS logic
```

Tested the Streamlit app using:

```bash
streamlit run src/main.py
```

## ðŸ§­ Notes & Next Steps

- **Pause for now** to review and reflect instead of mindlessly copying
- Tomorrow: revisit what each file does, how components connect, and how to begin using real data + AI models (Ollama, FAISS, Reddit API, etc.)
- Consider capturing a visual diagram or architecture map for better clarity

## ðŸ’¬ Personal Reflection

> "Right now, I'm not coding to show off. I'm learning to understand how things fit together â€” from GitHub to Streamlit to real-time AI agents."

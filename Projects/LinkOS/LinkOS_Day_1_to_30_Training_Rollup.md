# LinkOS: Day 1–30 Training Roll-Up

**Focus Areas:**  
- CompTIA ITF+ (Tech+)  
- A+ Core 1 (220-1101)  
- A+ Core 2 (220-1102)  
- Security+ (SY0-601) Foundations

---

## 🧭 Overview

The first 30 days of LinkOS training established the foundational skill set necessary for IT fundamentals, hardware and operating system troubleshooting, basic networking, endpoint protection, and cybersecurity hygiene.

Each day introduced one or more exam objectives supported by:
- A TryHackMe lab
- A portfolio-building project
- One or more hands-on tools installed and verified

The toolset was curated to avoid overwhelming the learner, introducing commands and utilities only when relevant to the lesson.

## 🗓️ Milestones by Week

### 🔹 Days 1–7: ITF+ (Tech+)
- Navigated the file system using CLI (`ls`, `cd`, `touch`)
- Created Python and SQLite-based automation tasks
- Used TryHackMe’s "Intro to Cybersecurity", "Linux Fundamentals", and "Intro to Python"
- Learned file permissions, basic networking, and data structures
- Took and passed a simulated ITF+ exam on Day 7

### 🔹 Days 8–15: A+ Core 1
- Identified and mapped system hardware using `inxi` and `lshw`
- Used `traceroute`, `ip`, and `nmap` for basic connectivity and scanning
- Set up and documented a virtual machine with ZeroDayOS
- Practiced mobile device management and display diagnostics
- Reviewed and completed a full Core 1 practice exam by Day 15

### 🔹 Days 16–22: A+ Core 2
- Installed and configured Windows and Linux OS in a VM
- Simulated endpoint protection with `clamav`, `fail2ban`, and permission hardening
- Practiced malware removal procedures and service troubleshooting
- Drafted IT policies and a service change control scenario
- Completed the Core 2 exam prep by Day 22

### 🔹 Days 23–30: Security+ Prep
- Explored network threats and mapped them to MITRE ATT&CK
- Created encryption and hashing demos using `openssl`, `gpg`, and `hashdeep`
- Developed basic firewall rules using `nftables` and system monitoring via `systemctl`
- Practiced vulnerability scanning with `nmap` and endpoint hardening
- Compiled all learning into a final Security+ readiness portfolio and lab log

## 🔧 Tools Introduced and Integrated

- 🔴 **Red Team**: `nmap`, `dig`, `traceroute`
- 🔵 **Blue Team**: `clamav`, `fail2ban`, `hashdeep`, `nft`, `rsync`, `gpg`, `systemctl`
- 🟣 **Purple Team**: `python3`, `sqlite3`, `git`, `bash`, `nano`, `grep`, `curl`, `wget`, `neofetch`

Each tool was verified through a custom CLI checklist script and used in documentation, labs, or automation tasks.

## 📁 Project Outcomes

- Daily documentation in Obsidian or Markdown files
- Screenshots of tool usage, network maps, and scan results
- `.desktop` launcher structure created for Day 30 snapshot
- `/etc/skel` prepared with Red, Blue, Purple team desktop icons
- All Day 30 tools verified using `Check_LinkOS_Day_30_Tools_Corrected.sh`

## 🚀 Snapshot-Ready

LinkOS Day 30 is now a validated distro snapshot:
- Tools installed and categorized
- Launchers built for Red/Blue/Purple workflows
- Learner can open the distro and begin using tools immediately

This build is ready for ISO creation and progression into:
- Day 60 (CySA+, Network+, PenTest+)
- Day 90 (SecurityX / CASP+)
